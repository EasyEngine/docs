<p>As EasyEngine is a large project, the following list is divided based on the area of expertise.</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Docker (Container) Hosting</strong> - If you are using Docker or containers in general in Production to host WordPress sites, we need your help. Please get in touch with project lead Rahul directly at rahul.bansal@rtcamp.com</li>
    <li><strong>Debian Package Building</strong> - EasyEngine as of now (v3) uses its own <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:rtCamp:EasyEngine">Nginx build hosted on OpenSuse</a>. If you are familiar with Debian package building and/or OpenSuse build service, you can help us keep Nginx version updated.</li>
    <li><strong>Server Management</strong> - While the focus on EasyEngine is to make running a WordPress site on EasyEngine easy, managing a VPS involves a lot more work which we want to automate. If you know a tool or have scripts which you think can benefit EasyEngine users, please create an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/easyengine/easyengine/issues">Github issue tracker</a>.</li>
</ol>
