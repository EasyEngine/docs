We use SVN to manage our source codes for different projects. SVN uses http-based authentication.

Below are commands to manage SVN users:
<h3>Adding a user</h3>
<pre>htpasswd -b /path/to/svn-auth-file username password</pre>
<h3>DeletingÂ  a user</h3>
<pre>htpasswd -D /path/to/svn-auth-file user.name</pre>
