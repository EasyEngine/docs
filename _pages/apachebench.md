<h3>Conventions:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Target machine - a machine which is being benchmarked</li>
	<li>Host machine - a machine from where benchmark is initiated</li>
</ol>
<strong>Note:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>We can use same machine as target and host machine.</li>
	<li>We can run benchmark from multiple "host machines". In facts more is better.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Install apachebench (apache2-utils)</h3>
Following command will install apachebench (ab command). Run it on host machine from where test is conducted.
<pre>apt-get install apache2-utils</pre>
<h3>Run "htop" on target machine</h3>
Install htop if its not installed already.
<pre>apt-get install htop</pre>
Then simply run <code>htop</code>Â in a dedicated window/terminal.
<h3>Running Apachebench</h3>
Following example will run apachebench on example.com:
<pre class="no-highlight">ab -n 10000 -c 10000 http://example.com/</pre>
<ul>
	<li>n = number of total requests</li>
	<li>c = number of concurrency (yep, this is same concurrency <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C10k_problem">c10k problem</a> refers to)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Sample output</h4>
Following is sample apachebench output:
<pre class="no-highlight">This is ApacheBench, Version 2.3 &lt;$Revision: 1430300 $&gt;

<h3>Interpreting Results</h3>
Out of all tools I have used apachebench is most unfriendly.

<strong>Failed Request Count</strong>

First, you can ignore length-related "Failed requests" count. HTTP headers can change response length for replies.

<strong>Percentage of the requests served within a certain time (ms)</strong>

If you are subjecting your server to unrealistic load, you should bother for 90% requests.
