You can setup mail forwarding (conditionally as well as unconditionally) using RoundCube filters. This is added by roundcube pluginÂ <a href="http://plugins.roundcube.net/packages/johndoh/sieverules">sieverules</a>.
<h2>Setup Forwarding</h2>
Listed below are steps to forward all emails to other mailbox.
<ol start="0">
	<li>Log into RoundCube (webmail) interface.</li>
	<li>Click on "Personal Settings" in top-right corner.</li>
	<li>Click on "+" sign in bottom-left corner to bring new filter screen.</li>
	<li>Give a name to your filter. In screenshot, I named it "Forward".</li>
	<li>Then under "Filter Rules", select "All messages". You can try other options here as well.</li>
	<li>Then under "Filter Actions", select "Send a copy to" from dropdown menu. It will show a text-input field on right. Just enter destination email address where you want incoming emails to be forwarded.</li>
	<li>Finally, click "Save" button.</li>
</ol>
