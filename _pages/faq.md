<h4 id="q1">Q 1. Are you 100% sure that Nginx will make my site fast?</h4>
One word answer is NO<strong></strong>. While we are 100% sure that Nginx drastically reduces CPU and memory usage as compared to Apache, we cannot guarantee that switching to Nginx <span style="font-weight: bold;">alone</span> will make your site run like fast. We can only assure you that moving to Nginx will not slow down your site further.

<h4 id="q2">Q 2. How do I decide if I need to move to Nginx?</h4>
If your site is low-traffic and/or you are addicted to WordPress plugins, chances are more that it is a bad plugin which is making your site slow. You can test the plugins. Please follow these simple steps:
<ol>
	<li>Activate one plugin at a time and check the speed of your website using popular speed checking tools.</li>
	<li>Do this with all your plugin to find the plugin which is hampering your website's performance.</li>
	<li>Once you figure out the plugin which is hampering your website's performance, find an alternative to it.</li>
</ol>
You can also hire us for customized theme and plugin development.

<h4 id="q3">Q 3. I never heard about Nginx? What will happen to my site if you run away tomorrow?</h4>
Neither Nginx nor WordPress are products developed by us. They are free and open-source products with a huge support community.

There are many companies/freelancers which provides commercial-support in addition to free help you will always get from open-source community. So if we run away tomorrow, you will find someone else to take care of your servers.
<a class="rtp-font-size-14" href="#header">Back to top ↑</a>
<h4 id="q4">Q 4. How do I access Cpanel of my site? I want to create a domain?</h4>
Ngnix does not have any control panel built for it. This is also one of the reasons which makes Nginx faster as  typical control panel softwares like Cpanel/Plesk occupy a large chunk of CPU and Memory on your server.
<a class="rtp-font-size-14" href="#header">Back to top ↑</a>
<h4 id="q5">Q 5. How do I create a new domain on my server?</h4>
To create domain you need to use Linux commands. Or you can simply hire us. <a href="https://easyengine.io/wordpress-nginx/pricing/">We charge very less for such tasks</a>.
<a class="rtp-font-size-14" href="#header">Back to top ↑</a>
<h4 id="q6">Q 6. What is SFTP? Why don't you just gimme FTP that I am used to?</h4>
SFTP is secure version of FTP. SFTP uses SSH protocol which comes "pre-installed" with Linux while for FTP access, we need to install extra softwares on your server. It won't take our more than 2 minutes to install normal FTP on your server, but each extra software eats your CPU/memory.

To improve performance and security we recommend using SFTP only. Almost every FTP client you might have used till date provides SFTP connection support.
<a class="rtp-font-size-14" href="#header">Back to top ↑</a>
<h4 id="q7">Q 7. How do I access my database from web-browser without Cpanel?</h4>
Cpanel/Plesk uses <a href="http://www.phpmyadmin.net/">PhpMyAdmin</a> for providing web-interface to manage database server. In all our service packages, we install PhpMyAdmin on your server. If you are not able to find information regarding it, please <a href="https://easyengine.io/contact/">get in touch with us</a>. We will be glad to help you to reach  your PhpMyAdmin installation.

<h4 id="q8">Q 8. I came across <a href="https://easyengine.io/news/rtcamp-beats-google-in-yslow-page-speed-grades/">this post where your company site outperform Google.com</a>! Will I get same results if I move to Nginx?</h4>
Most probably NO. Nginx is one of many factors that we worked on to improve our site's performance.

As there are too many factors and restrictions in the overall process, we do not offer that level of optimization as a service. But we can surely help you configure a much faster site if you are willing to spend more.
<a class="rtp-font-size-14" href="#header">Back to top ↑</a>
<h4 id="q9">Q 9. What else you can do for my site to make it faster apart from Nginx setup?</h4>
Our favorite task is to remove/replace bad plugins and recommend plugins we are using from long time which are tried and tested by us.

Next comes your theme. A badly coded theme often adds significant overhead. A small example is using 20 small images/icons without CSS-spirits! That is why we code all themes from scratch.

Apart from that we can setup your WordPress to use CDN. We can also try enabling JavaScript/CSS minification, hosting Google Analytics locally and other similar tasks which together will improve your sites performance.

All above tasks require consistent  efforts over a period of time. If you are willing to spend a little more, we assure you it will be totally worth it.

<h4 id="q10">Q 10. I don't need your full-services. I am geek and I just need your help on some small part. What should I do?</h4>
We recommend going for free help through our <a href="https://easyengine.io/support/forum/wordpress-nginx/">support forums</a>. If that doesn't work out, we can think of paid-consultancy but if you are a real geek, chances are less that we know much more than you! ;-)
