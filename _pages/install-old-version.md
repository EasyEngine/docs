We always recommend to go with latest version of EE. Old version may have some issues which has been fixed in latest version.

However,Â you can install old version using this command:
<pre><code>wget -qO ee rt.cx/ee &amp;&amp; sudo bash ee v3.4.0</code></pre>
&nbsp;

Where <code>v3.4.0</code> is release tag can be found on github repo <a href="https://github.com/EasyEngine/easyengine/tags">https://github.com/EasyEngine/easyengine/tags</a>.
