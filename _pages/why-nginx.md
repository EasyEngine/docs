Below are some key points which should help you make your decision:
<ol>
	<li>
<h3><strong>Smart Architecture</strong>:</h3>
Nginx and Apache are the most used open source web servers. However for larger web setups, Nginx outperforms Apache. Nginx hosting uses an Asynchronous approach which is event-driven for handling requests. This provides predictable performance under load, as against the Apache HTTP server which makes use of a threaded or process oriented approach for the same.</li>
	<li>
<h3><strong>Opensource:</strong></h3>
Nginx is <a title="NetCraft Web Survey" href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2012/04/04/april-2012-web-server-survey.html">second most used</a> open source web server. The compatibility with most modern OS including Windows and Linux makes it an optimal choice.</li>
	<li>
<h3><strong>Smaller Size, Better Performance:</strong></h3>
Though Nginx is smaller in size, it multiplies the performance remarkably by reducing the RAM and CPU usage for real time applications.</li>
	<li>
<h3><strong>Scalability:</strong></h3>
The features like load balancing, logical infrastructure, easy configuration, predicable performance and flexibility makes it a scalable solution for larger businesses and websites which handle millions of visitors every day.</li>
	<li>
<h3><strong>Stability</strong>:</h3>
Today over 10% of top 1 million sites are using Nginx. It is exclusively designed for heavy traffic websites with load balancing support as well as proxy support. If you are a system administration techy, Nginx is absolutely the best choice for you.</li>
