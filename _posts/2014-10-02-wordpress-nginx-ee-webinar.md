While it is obviously not possible for everyone to attend <a href="http://nginx.com/resources/webinars/taste-nginx-conf-wordpress-nginx-best-practices-easyengine/">nginx.conf has arranged for a webinar</a> on “WordPress + NGINX Best Practices with EasyEngine”.

It will be presented by our very own Rahul Bansal (<a href="https://easyengine.io/blog/meet-easyengine-nginx-conf-2014-san-francisco-usa/">read his post</a>).

Join this webinar today (October 2) at 10:00 PM (IST) to learn how, whether for speed, security or scalability, a WordPress site can be improved using NGINX, for example:
<ul>
	<li>Fastcgi_cache can be used for caching dynamically generated pages. If configured correctly, visitors can read articles, even if the php/mysql backend has crashed.</li>
	<li>Memcache module – if WordPress site is spread across multiple servers, memcache can be used instead of fastcgi_cache, so multiple servers can have a shared cache.</li>
	<li>Load balancer – when used across multiple servers, NGINX can be used as a conventional load balancer optionally with proxy_cache.</li>
	<li>Upstream and hhvm – as hhvm sometimes breaks with some plugins, NGINX upstream block can pass requests to HHVM first and if hhvm crashes, can send requests to php-fpm.</li>
</ul>
