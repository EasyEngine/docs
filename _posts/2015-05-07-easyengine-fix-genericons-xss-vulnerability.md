A XSS Vulnerability is discovered in <a href="http://genericons.com/" target="_blank">Genericons</a> library present in WordPress default theme TwentyFifteen as well as famous Jetpack plugin. More details about this can be found on <a href="http://wptavern.com/xss-vulnerability-in-jetpack-and-the-twenty-fifteen-default-theme-affects-millions-of-wordpress-users" target="_blank">WPTavern</a> and <a href="https://blog.sucuri.net/2015/05/jetpack-and-twentyfifteen-vulnerable-to-dom-based-xss.html" target="_blank">Sucuri</a>.

The easiest way to fix this is to upgrade your WordPress sites to 4.2.2. If for some reason, you can't do that you can add following codes to nginx config:
<pre class="no-highlight">location ~* /example.html {
 deny all;
}
</pre>
<h2>EasyEngine Users</h2>
We have added this code to <a href="https://github.com/rtCamp/easyengine/releases/tag/v3.1.4" target="_blank">EasyEngine v3.1.4</a>.

Existing users simply need to run following update command to get latest version of EasyEngine:
<pre class="no-highlight">ee update</pre>
Above one command will forbid access to affected example.html files on your server.

You need to run above command once to fix this for all WordPress sites on your server.
