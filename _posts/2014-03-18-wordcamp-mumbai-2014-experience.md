rtCamp's<a href="https://easyengine.io/rtcamp-5-years/"> 5th Anniversary</a> was followed by <a href="http://2014.mumbai.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Mumbai</a>, on March 15th and 16th, 2014 <em>(i.e. last weekend)</em>.

In this WordCamp, Rahul Bansal <em>(that's me)</em> choose to speak about our <a href="http://rtcamp.com/easyengine">EasyEngine</a> project. This way me, many other rtCampers and EasyEngine attended our first WordCamp!

Below are our memories...
<h2>Day-1: WordCamp Mumbai</h2>
WordCamp was opened by <a href="http://ideasmithy.wordpress.com/">Ideasmithy</a> with "<a title="SlideShare link to Ideasmithy's talk" href="http://www.slideshare.net/ideasmithy/an-analog-in-a-digital-world"><em>An Analog in Digital World</em></a>" talk. It was really nice and set the tone for rest of the event.

The session by <a href="http://wpeka.com/" target="_blank">Karthik Magapu</a> on <a title="Slideshare link to Karthik's talk" href="http://www.slideshare.net/WPEka/wc-mumbai-gpl-v12">GPL</a> was very interesting. He summarized GPL like never before and gave interesting bits of history on GPL and it's creator. Few months ago we choose <a href="https://easyengine.io/easyengine-is-gpl/">GPL for EasyEngine</a> and the process was very painful. I hope his session will help attendee choose GPL easily for their future project. :-)

Another interesting session on Day-1 was by <a href="http://brajeshwar.me/">Brajeshwar</a> about making theme development workflow easy. I am not able to find link to his slides but I guess <a href="https://github.com/theme6/wp-portkey">this github repo</a> has all the important stuff from his session. I was positively shocked to know that our theme development team is already following practices Brajeshwar suggested. :-)
<h3>EasyEngine Session</h3>
Last session for the day-1 was by me (Rahul Bansal). As it was my first WordCamp, I was a bit nervous. My session started with a configuration issue between my Mac and projector. It took some time and made me further nervous as you can see in following picture...

When other 3 fellas in above pic were troubleshooting the issue, <a href="http://yapapaya.com">Saurabh Shukla</a> asked audience if they have heard about Nginx? Almost 80% people raised hands which made me happy and confident. Of course, everybody wish to present in front of right audience! :-)

I guess our EasyEngine session was received well and people liked EasyEngine. Atleast it looks like from following tweets... ;-)

<h2>Day-2: WordCamp Mumbai</h2>
Day-2 was very unexpected. I thought I will get bore as my most fellow rtCampers already left for Pune previous night.

From the moment I reached venue, till the end of the day, I was constantly getting questions about EasyEngine. I spent entire day answering questions, collecting valuable feedback and suggestions from fellow WordCampers.

Two talks, I liked on Day-2 were: <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/teamphp/wordpress-rapid-prototype"><em>"WordPress as Rapid Prototyping Tool"</em></a> by Amit Singh and of-course most-entertaining <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/AnnkurAgarwal/known-seo-no-seo-a-more-powerful-approach-to-seo"><em>"No SEO"</em></a>  talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/annkur">Ankur Agarwal</a>.

<span style="color: #222222; font-size: 2.5rem; line-height: 1.4;">Overall...</span>

A successful event, organised and managed by the closely knit team of great volunteers, led by <a href="http://www.bombaypirate.com/">Aditya Kane</a> and <a href="http://www.gounder.co.in/">Alexander Gounder</a>. Their months of efforts were very visible everywhere. Neat registration process, well-followed talk timings and the variety of topics were some of the examples of this.

All I can say, we will eagerly wait for future WordCamps! :-)
