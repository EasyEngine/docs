Today <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/12/clifford/">WordPress 4.4 “Clifford”</a> has been released. If the existing EasyEngine users have not updated their WP-CLI version, they will be facing issues creating new websites.

Realizing this issue, we have released EasyEngine 3.3.15. The earlier versions of EasyEngine are not compatible to upgrade to WP-CLI version 0.21.1.

However, it is essential to have the latest version of WP-CLI for WordPress 4.4.

Hence, we have extended the compatibility of EasyEngine to work with latest WP-CLI version. Additionally, the latest version of EasyEngine will enable users to automatically migrate to latest version of WP-CLI.
<h2>ChangeLog</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Updated to WP-CLI version 0.21.1 which is compatible with WordPress 4.4</li>
</ul>
<h2>Upgrading To EasyEngine 3.3.15</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Existing users can simply run <code>ee update</code> to upgrade EasyEngine and WP-CLI to the latest version</li>
</ul>
