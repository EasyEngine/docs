This morning we woke up to <a href="https://github.com/EasyEngine/easyengine/issues/968">multiple</a> <a href="https://github.com/EasyEngine/easyengine/issues/971">issues</a> <a href="https://github.com/EasyEngine/easyengine/issues/969">being</a> reported which were all related pymysql3 package. EasyEngine was not even installable.

The package has been deprecated a while ago but we did not take any action assuming we will release ee v4 before it gets removed from Python Package Index. We switched to <code>PyMySQL</code>.Â For discussion refer: <a href="https://github.com/EasyEngine/easyengine/issues/969">https://github.com/EasyEngine/easyengine/issues/969</a>.

We also updated to<code>wp-cli</code> version to 1.4.1.

We released EasyEngine v3.7.5 today. <a href="https://github.com/EasyEngine/easyengine/releases/tag/v3.7.5">Release link</a>
