<p class="p1">Two days ago we had released EasyEngine v3.7.0 with PHP 7.0 support for Debian Jessie and some minor fixes.</p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">PHP7 on Debian</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On Feb 24, 2016 we <a href="https://easyengine.io/blog/easyengine-3-5-php7-support/">released PHP7 for Ubuntu,</a> and skipped Debian support. </span><span class="s1">Reason being PHP 7 was not available in Debian repositories and building PHP packages for Debian would have taken a lot of time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But recently <a href="http://dotdeb.org/"><span class="s2">dotdeb.org</span></a> released <a href="https://www.dotdeb.org/2015/12/04/php-7-0-0-is-available-for-jessie/">PHP7 for Debian Jessie</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All other details and command can be found <a href="https://easyengine.io/docs/php7/">here</a>.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">NGINX &amp; OpenSSL</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this week we also fixed and upgraded our Nginx packages with latest version of OpenSSL (v1.0.2h). </span></p>
