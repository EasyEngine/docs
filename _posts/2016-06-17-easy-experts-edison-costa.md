<h2>Interview</h2>
<strong>Q. Tell us a bit about your background in hosting / server management?</strong>

With over 30 years of experience in software development, I have always taken care of the infrastructure of my application servers. We have started using Windows servers and now we work exclusively with Linux servers.

The natural transition to Web applications and the experience derived from many Linux server installations optimized, allows us today to work with high conversion Blogs installation and virtual stores with huge demand of users.

<strong>Q. Where are you based out of? Do you have a collaborative team? Tell us a bit more about your team.</strong>

We are located in the city of São Paulo, Brazil, at our most famous and important avenue (Paulista’s Avenue), and our firm consists in a team of 5 employees constantly trained to maintain the high level of services.

<strong>Q. How did you discover EasyEngine?</strong>

My first major professional challenge was to create and develop a script for Magento e-commerce installation. Considering the high number of clients using WordPress and the exchange of e-commerce for platform WooCommerce, I began research on GitHub for installation scripts. In 2014, I discovered the fantastic EasyEngine, still in its version 1.3.8.

<strong>Q. What do you use EasyEngine mainly for?</strong>

Today, we use the EasyEngine at all stages of the project, in the the project development with Vagrant + EasyEngine, until the final deployment into the production environment.

<strong>Q. Why would you recommend using EasyEngine?</strong>

EasyEngine is an easy application to use, robust and delivers a super optimized and most reliable server.
