# Requesting Support
If you are facing any issue which is or is not related to EasyEngine, you can post in [EasyEngine community forums](https://community.easyengine.io/). EasyEngine team keeps monitoring forums and if they find any post which has issue which might be caused due to EasyEngine, we will create an issue on github.

## Slack
We don’t encourage slack usage at all. It’s like [we do have Slack](https://easyengine.slack.com/). We often discuss things there. You are welcome to join. But if you expect the core team to take action or reply on any feedback, its better be posted in the community forum.

## Github
Again, go to the community forum. Once we verify a bug there, we will move it to Github issues. We want to keep issue our tracker clean.

## Paid Support
 EasyEngine's parent company rtCamp provides fully managed hosting & support retainers for ongoing needs. [You can contact them here](https://rtcamp.com/contact/).

We have a directory of a select few EasyEngine experts who may be able to provide you premium support. You can get in touch with them through [EasyExperts directory](https://easyengine.io/easyexperts/).
