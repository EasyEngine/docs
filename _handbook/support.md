<p>Before you look for support, please</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li><a href="https://easyengine.io/docs/">read the docs</a></li><li><a href="https://community.easyengine.io/">search existing topics in community forum</a></li><li>you may try a Google search also</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, if you still need support from a human, you can <a href="https://community.easyengine.io/">post your question in community forum</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Community Forum</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the <a href="https://community.easyengine.io/">community forum</a>, EasyEngine users are helping each other mostly. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>EasyEngine developers scan support forum for bugs and issues which require a fix in the EasyEngine itself. If the EE team finds an issue, they will create a Github issue in relevant repo themselves. Please do not flood Github issue tracker.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Slack</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://easyengine.slack.com/">We do have Slack</a> team but the goal is to coordinate with developer team and forum moderators. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We discourage using slack for support questions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Github</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Again, please go to the <a href="https://community.easyengine.io/">community forum</a>. Once we verify a bug there, we will move it to Github issues. We want to keep issue tracker clean to stay productive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Commercial Support</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We have a directory of a select few EasyEngine experts who are able to provide commercial support for a reasonable fees. You can get in touch with them through <a href="https://easyengine.io/easyexperts/">EasyExperts directory</a>.</p>
